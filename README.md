# powerslice
A smart USB PD based power splitter enabling charging of many devices from a single source

The goal of PowerSlice is to take a single, high-power USB PD power source (for example, a USB C laptop charger) and split its power to charge a number of smaller/lower power devices. 

The form of this device will be a small, portable block (similar in size to a portable charger or a USB-C dongle) with an input USB-C input port and 4-6 USB outputs, consisting of a combination of USB A and USB C. The input will be USB-PD compatible, supporting a 20V 5A input (consistent with common max power of USB-C PD). The outputs will be a combination of USB-PD (probably a max of 3) and more standard 5V only outputs.
